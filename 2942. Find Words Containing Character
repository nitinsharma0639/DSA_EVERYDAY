You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.



Solution:


class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findWordsContaining(String[] words, char x) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int index = 0; index < words.length; index++) {
            String word = words[index];
            
            // Check if the character x is present in the word
            if (word.indexOf(x) != -1) {
                list.add(index);
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
}
