Problem statement
You are given a number ’n’.



Find the number of digits of ‘n’ that evenly divide ‘n’.



Note:
A digit evenly divides ‘n’ if it leaves no remainder when dividing ‘n’.


Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 336

Output: 3

Explanation:
336 is divisible by both ‘3’ and ‘6’. Since ‘3’ occurs twice it is counted two times.
Note:
You don’t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.





Solution:

public class Solution {
    public static int countDigits(int n){
        int num = n;
      int cnt = 0;
      
        while (n > 0) {
        int ld = n % 10;
        if(ld != 0 && num%ld == 0){
            cnt = cnt + 1;
        }
            n = n / 10;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
